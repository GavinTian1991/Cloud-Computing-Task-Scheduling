# Cloud-Computing-Task-Scheduling

This is the UBC EECE571K 'Security and Reliability for the Internet of Things (IoT)' course project. The project's topic is: "Cloud Computing Task Scheduling in IoT Based on Ant Colony Optimization".

Cloud computing is the mainstream development tool of distributed computing, parallel computing and grid computing. One of the fundamental issues in this computing platform is related to massive task scheduling. An efficient task scheduling algorithm should adapt to different input tasks and cloud computing environment. In this paper, we make task scheduling makespan performance comparison between First Come First Served (FCFS), basic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm and one improved load balancing ACO algorithm. Algorithms have been simulated on CloudSim cloud computing simulation toolkit. The characteristics of scalability, reliability, availability and latency will also be evaluated in the experiments.

Environments:
Coding in 'Eclipse' with Java
